/*
 * How it works:
 * A pthread_t is a struct (2x32 bit scalar types on x86, 2x64 bit on x86_64)
 * [FIXME: This is not true, x86_64 is 64 bit pointer and 32 bit counter. This
 * should be fixed in version 3.0.0]
 * which is normally passed/returned by value to/from pthreads routines.
 * Applications are therefore storing a copy of the struct as it is at that
 * time.
 *
 * The original pthread_t struct plus all copies of it contain the address of
 * the thread state struct ptw32_thread_t_ (p), plus a reuse counter (x). Each
 * ptw32_thread_t contains the original copy of it's pthread_t (ptHandle).
 * Once malloced, a ptw32_thread_t_ struct is not freed until the process exits.
 *
 * The thread reuse stack is a simple LILO stack managed through a singly
 * linked list element in the ptw32_thread_t.
 *
 * Each time a thread is destroyed, the ptw32_thread_t address is pushed onto the
 * reuse stack after it's ptHandle's reuse counter has been incremented.
 *
 * The following can now be said from this:
 * - two pthread_t's refer to the same thread iff their ptw32_thread_t reference
 * pointers are equal and their reuse counters are equal. That is,
 *
 *   equal = (a.p == b.p && a.x == b.x)
 *
 * - a pthread_t copy refers to a destroyed thread if the reuse counter in
 * the copy is not equal to (i.e less than) the reuse counter in the original.
 *
 *   threadDestroyed = (copy.x != ((ptw32_thread_t *)copy.p)->ptHandle.x)
 *
